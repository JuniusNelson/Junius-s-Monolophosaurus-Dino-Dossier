                In 1981, Dong Zhiming, a Chinese

                paleontologist,made the discovery of

                a nearly complete skeleton belonging

                to a previously unknown theropod

                during strati-graphic exploration

                conducted for the oil industry. The

                fossil, however, remained buried until

                it was officially unearthed in 1984.

            <h2>genus</h2>

            <p class="p1">
                Monolophosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in the

                    Middle Jurassic period, approximately 165 million years ago. Fossils of

                    Monolophosaurus have been found in China, and it is characterized by a

                    distinctive crest on its snout, which gives it its name ("monolopho" means

                    "single crest"). This dinosaur was likely a carnivorous predator, and its

                    fossils contribute to our understanding of theropod evolution during the

                    Jurassic period.
